Pege 94. 1. Lyciis: abrave warrior tribe occupying a smalltract
called Lycia, on the southwestem side oi Asia Minor.

2. libertatem ademit: because, according to Dio, lx. 17, they had
alain certain Romans duringriota. Rhodiis. . . reddidit: 53 nn.
Dio, ix. 24, staoes that Claudius had deprived thern oi their liberty be·
cause they had crucified some Romans, and Tacitus, Aah. xii. 58, is
authority ior the statement that they had been oiten deprived oi their
liberty because oi internal discord, and had often won it baolr by
their service to the Romans in time oi war.

3. mannhun, eta: their ceusu was presented by Nsro; see Nero,
chap, 7. 23, and cs. Tac. Ann. xii. te. '

6. Seleuco: probably Seleucus ΙΙ., sumamed Callinichus. lta
demum . . . ei: only on the condition that, etc. ’

8. Iudaeos impulsore Chresto, etc: for the expulsion ol the
Jews by Tiberius, see note on p. 22. 1. The tumulis referred to were
probably due to contentione between the Jews aud Christiana, ior the
Romans regarded the latter simply aa a sect oi the former. By the
name Chrestus, Suetonius probably reiers to Christ, who irom the Ro-
man point oi view might well be the one who caused the disturbances.
The Romans felt nothing bnt contempt ior the Jews, and it is con-
oeivable that Suetonius, though he had heard oi Christ, was not aware
that he bad been executed in the reign oi Tiberius and that he had
never been at Rome. Both Tertullian, Apol. 3, aud Lactantius In-
stit. iv. 7. b, testiiy that the Romana, in their ignorance, rrsed the iorms
Chrestus and Chrestiani. Dio, lx. 6, states that Claudius, finding the
number oi Jews at Rome so grean that they could not be expelled
without causing tumults, simply iorbade those who observed the
J ewish rites meeting together. Dio probably refers to the Christiana
as well as the Jews, ior beneven uses the tormer name. Cf. Orosius,
vii. 6. 16, who quotes these words oi Suetonius and thus commenta
upon thern: quod utrum. contra Christum tumultuantes Iudaeos
coerceri et comprimi altaserram: etiam Christianos sinaut reiut caa-
’ natae religionis homines uoluerit expetit, nequaquam discernitur.

12. popularia: sc. ioca, scats assigned to the messes. cum
