Suetonius must have been about fifty years old at the
time of his dismissa] from the court of Hadrian. The rest

probably written during the early years of the reign of
Antoninus Pius. ¹

Hadrian who produced anything of importance. The chief
work of his which has been preserved, and by
whieh he is to be judged, is his Licea of tle
Caesare. Suetonius apparently used good
authority for almost all that he· wrote. He drew little from
Tacitus, and never mentions him. Pliny, no doubt, supplied
him 'with some material for his later Licea, but he, t00, is
passed over in silence. There is nothing to show that

with regard to the imperial court.

Suetonius is not an historian, for he neglecta even the ’

great public happenings of the times, except in so far as

they relate to the -Caesars as individuale. He ·

the term, as an analysis of the Licea will show.
