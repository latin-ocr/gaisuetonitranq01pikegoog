Gaetulicus in 39 mn: “Gaius ordered Lentulus Gaetulicus put to
death; he was a man of distinction and had been governor oi Ger-
many ior ten years. The charge was that he had endeavored to curry
lavor with the army.” Dio then goes on to say that Lepidus, who
had been on very intimate terms with Caligula, by whom he had
been selected as his successor to the throne, was also put to death.v
Tlrereupon Caligula granted a largess to the army, “as though he =
had triumphed over the enemy.'’ Dio evidently does not believe in
the truth oi these charges, ior he continues, “Galus wrote and sent
to the senate an account oi these matters, as though he had escaped
from plots against his liic. On other occasions, tou, he was wont to
feign that his lile was passed amid great dangers.’'
