four parties or factione, named respectively, sectio albula (white),
prasino (green), rosata (red), and corteto (blue). When Domitian
instituted the practice oi starting six, instead of four, chariots at once,
two new factione were added, sectio curata (golden) and purpura
(purple), but these were not long kept up. There were frequent riots
and encounters between these various sections, the worst oi which
occurred at Constantinople in 532 sm. (the Nice rebellion), in which
thirty thousand are said to have perished.
