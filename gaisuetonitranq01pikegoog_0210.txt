Paga 25. 2. ignotissimum: see introd. II. 54, e.

4. amphoram: an amphora contained about seven galions. It
seems probabis, in view oi the present passage, that the word was

oi this construction, see Nero, chap. 49. 28 and note.

Β. tenu: this is contradicted by the statements oi Tacitus and
Velleius Patercuius. The former, Ana. i. 75, states that Tiberius was
always ready to pay out money ior honorable projecte, a virtue he re-
tained aiter lesing all others; and again, iii. 18, he terms him, soils
firmas adversam peccatam. The latter, ii. 130, says that he assisted
many with his own private means, especially at the time that the
Caelian hili was ravagcd by fire. Dio, lvii. 10, aiter enumerating
acts oi generosity, adds: “He never killed any one to secure his

that hc did complete these two weris, but only these, and that he leit
them undedioated, either because oi his advanced age, or because he
scorned display. Dio, lvii. 10, states that his only new work was the
temple oi Augustus; and this is probably correct, as it was only the
stage oi Pompey’s theatro that Tiberius reconstructed. It is believed
that the temple of Augustus stood on the side oi the Palatine iaciug
the Capitol. Pompey’s theatro was built in 55 aa, and was the first
permanent theatro at Rome. ’

19. rarissime interfuit: contradicted by Dio, lvii. 11, who says
