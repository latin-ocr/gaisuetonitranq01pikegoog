1⁵. diaetam: diaeta (lit. ‘a place ior living') does not signiiy
any definite kind ol room. lt means, in different connectione, a
sleeping room, a dining room, a summer house, or even a suite oi
apartments. It means hers one oi Claudius* rooms in the palate.

16. ' Hermaeum: perhaps so named from a stetue in the apert
ment.

17. solarium: the diceto probably opened on aportion oi the rooi
of the palace used as a terrace (solariam). The doorway or swinging
window leading to this terrace was draped with a curtain. The word
solarium is also, in Nero, chap. 16. 29, used to signify the roois oi
porticoes. The account oi the discovery¹ oi Claudius is very much
the same in both Dio, lx. 1, and Josephus, Ant. lad. xix. 3. The
account of the latter is, however, much more detailed. They both say
that Claudius was found hiding in a dark corner. Josephus gives the
name Gratus to the soldier who discovered him.

desire toflatl ont wito it was (be loched) aad recoyaized him. The

trying to hide, and his curiosity was aroused. Inasmuoh as the
expression e studio sciscitandi. . . adgnovit, ‘irom the desire of
finding out . . . ho recognized,’ is not strictly logical, Madvig sus-
pects that the word adgnovit has crept into the text, and amends to
read stadio concitandi quisnam esset, eta, salutavit. The expression
can hardly be misunderstood, however, and is used ior the sake oi
brevity.
