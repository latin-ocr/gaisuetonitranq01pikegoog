Tiberius was the heir 01 Augustus, but the latter did not have the
right 1ο bequeath his power as princeps. The 011-11001000 Livia,
because 01 her native ability and her exalted position (she had been
adopted by Augustus in his will, and had received the name dulia and
the title Augusta), had a large following 01 devoted friends. German-
icus, more closely related to Augustus than Tiberius and dearly loved
by his soldiers, might have been a dangerous rival had he so willed.
These 10010 made Tiberius cautious, and only gradually did he assume
complete control 01 the governmeut. Τ110 death 01 Germanicus in
the 11001, removing, as it did, a possible rival, was generally attributed
to poison administered by Piso at the instigationes Tiberius. 01 this,
however, there is absolutely no proot. Early in the reign, the election

, 01 magistrates passed from the comitia to the senate. This body

Tiberius treated with studied respect. Many 01 110 members, however,
he viewed with suspicion, and a wider application was‘given 10 the
law ot troason, resulting in the growth 01 00 iniamous class 01 pro-
tessional intormers. 01 great significance was the concontratio'n in
0 permanent camp 01 110100 01 1110 0100101100 00110010. Their com-
mende-r, Sejanus, became the most powevtul official under the emperor.
On the 1011 01 Seianus, Macro succeeded 00 praefectus praetorto. The
prolonged absence 01 Tiberius from Rome resulted in making his
representative in the city (the praefectus arbi) apermanent official.
Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio Cassius agree in pieturing Tiberius as
aman 01 gloom and suspicion, who finally degenerated into 0 blood-
thirsty tyrant. Velleius, who treats 01 1110 period before Tiberius'
accession and the early years 01 1110 principato, writes in astyle so
laudatory that 110 excites suspicion as to his sincerity. Tacitus is
unjust, in 11101 110 attributes to Tiberius those motives that best
support his own theory, which was that Tiberius was a hypocrite dur-
ing 011 1110 earlier years, and only in the latter portion 01 1110 1110
shewed his true colors. All three note a change tor the worse in
