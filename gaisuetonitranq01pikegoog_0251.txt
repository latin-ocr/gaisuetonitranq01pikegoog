28. paegniariis: the text is difficult here. The reading is that of
Roth (he givesthe contracted form paegniaris, ior pecatores, the reed-
ing oi the Memmian manuscript). Peprvtores is that oi the Medicean
lst arrd 3d. The lacuna before quoque is to be filled by supplying
mediatoribus, or some word oi similar meaning. Poepnme'as (Gr'.
παίγνιον, ‘plaything') means ‘pertaining to playl’ The passage
apparently means: ‘He turned wild betete, all wasted away, against
worthless gladiators worn out by age, and pitted against make-believe
gladiatore householders, respectable, but noted ior some bodily
deiect’
