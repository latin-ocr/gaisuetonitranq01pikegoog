xx INTRODUCTION. 111.

0. Tamquam and quusi are sometimes used, as inlecitus,

infinitivo might have been expected:

tenetque opinio remquam 01 nutus r'bi stt, Auo. 6 ; increbrescente
rumore quusi . .. commoraretur, Tib. 11.

d. Et with the force 01 etium is very common.

e. Quo is used 10 1111101111οο a clause 01 purpose where no
comparison is involved:

quo . . . subduceret, 11122.

f. Donec is used with the subjunctive in a statement 01
fact.

Viewed as awhole, the Latin 01 Suetonius is not so closely
modelled on the Ciceronian style as that 01 Quintilian or

that 01 Pliny the Younger, nor does it exhibit such marked ,

peculiarities 01 the Silver Age as do the diction 01 Seneca
and Tacitus. Ι1 does not present many difficulties, and is

admirably adapted 10 the purpose 01 its author. Ι
