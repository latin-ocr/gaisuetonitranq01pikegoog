Agrippina had poisoned Claudius soon after she had prevailed upon
him to disregard his own son Britannicus and to adopt her son Nero.
The latter was immediately proclaimed emperor by the praetoriana.
At first Nero allowed affairs to be managed by his imperlous mother,
by Seneca, hls tutor, and by Burrus, the praeiect of the guarda.
During these years the flnances were v'vell managed, the senate treated
with consideration, and administrativa reforma instituted. After the
murder of Agrippina, the death 01 Burrus, and the retirement oi Sen-
eca, Nero fell under the influenoe 01 Tigellinus, his praefectae prae·
torio, and of his freedmen. The treasury was depleted, the coinage
debesed, and the senate disregarded. The city was laid waste hya
conflagration‚ which popular rumor attributed to Nero. The Chris-
tiane, whose name now first appears in history, were charged with
the deed by Nem, and prosecuted. Ἰ

In the suppression of the conspiracy 01 Piso, many eminent men
perished, notably Seneca and Lucan. Owing 1ο 110 widespread dis-
content‚ Vindex, governor 01 Gaul, revolted, and was joined by Galba,
, governor 01 Lusitania. Verginius Rufus, with the legions 01 Upper
Germany, defeated Vindex, but the victorious troops themselves turned
against Nero. Amid these disturbances he fell by his own hand.
