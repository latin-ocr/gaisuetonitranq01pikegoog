The accession oi Gaius, son oi Germanicus, was hailed with delight.
The informers were suppressed aud electiou oi magistrates was restored
to the assemblies. These and other reiorms were shortlived, how-
ever, ior Gaius soon reverted to the system oi Tiberius, though lacking
Tiberius' ability as an administrator. Great power, moreover‚ turned
his wealr head. He claimed divine honore, undertook ridiculous cam-
paigns, and equandered the resouroes ot the empire in wild schemes.
The ancient authorities are oue in drawing the portrait oi a madmen,
and their pagos are filled with the accounts oi his insane antics. The
only important constitutioual change was the formation ot a fifth
decury ot jurors.
