annor snit . . . nt curo cerari a quaestoribus urbanis cci praetorios
praetoresue transiret. During the republio quaestore had charge oi the
public treasury. Two aediles were given temporary charge by Caesar.
The different changes irum that time are stated hy Tacitus, Ann. xiii.¹
29. Augustus first allowed the senate to choosc praefecte of the treas-
ury. As intrigue was employed in their selection, they were aiter-
ward drawn by lot irom the praetore. This often resulted in the
appointment oi incompetent men, so that Claudius restored the quaes-
tors. The quaestore lacked· experiente, however, and Nero chose such
ss had passed the praetorship and were oi tried ability.

³2. praetura mnetl: the expression praetera, consolatu, etc,
suncti is oiien used in the imperial period to distinguish those who
had actually held an office from those who had slmply had the title, a
distinction not expressed by the words praetorii, consulares, etc.

Pege 93. 1. ornamenta Silano, etc: Claudius had done all that
he could to make the man popular; cf. Tac. Aren. xii. 3. illine:

· Octavia. Fumeaux refers the conierring oi the honorary triumph to

the year 44 n.o.,oonsider1ng Suetonius' statement, nonduin puberi,
an exaggeration. Dio, lx. 31, however, corroboratas Suetonius.

2. maioribus vero natu tam multis: os. Dio, lx 23: “He not
only bestowed the insignio triumphalia upon the consulare who had
served in the campaign in Britain, but upon senators as well 3 he was
accuetomed‚ in fact, to bestow this honor lavishly, ior the most trivial
aohievements.''

4. utlagatis consularibus, etc: Tacitus’ explanation (Ann. xi.
- 20) oi this request is, that generals who did not have the opportunity
ol gaining this distinction in war tried to' secure it in other ways, digging
canals, working mines, etc, and thus wore out their soldiers by hard
labor.
