25. inlatum deinde Augusti testamentum: Suetonius, 111. 101,
gives an extended account 11 this will. Tiberius and Livia are made
heirs Legacies to hia relatives and friends, to the Roman people,
legions, praetorian soldiers and cohorte, are enumerated. The will
also states that many 11 the legacies leit to Augustus had been expended
by himin the interestis 11 the state. It is forbidden thatthe two 111111,
his daughter and granddaughter, be buried in his tomb. Os. Dio, lvi.
32 ; Tacitus, Aac. i. 8, “ At the first session 11 111 senate, he allowed
nothing to be discussed but the funeral ceremonias 11 Augustus. The
will was brought in by the Vestals, and it was found that 'liberius and
Livia were appointed his heirs.’'

26. signatoribus . . . agnoscentibus: it was customary ior the
witnesses both to sign and place their seale upon a will. The seal
and signature were placed upon the outside 11 the document

30. ex parte dimidia et sextante: i† ,ly = 33 beree 11 beare
might have been used to express ‘heir to two-thirds 11 111 estate.¹
Since the Romans used a duodecimal system in expressing their irac-
tions‚ the 11 being the unit, the shores into which an ’1111111111 was
divided was expressed in twelfths; 11. heres 111111, ‘hairto the
whole’; 11 semisse, ι11111«1111’; 1111111111, ‘to one·third,' etc.

Paga 16. 3. principatum: tte ennium lit ‘the principate,' the
word used to signiiy the rule oi the princepe, which last title best
expresses the position oi the emperor, as head oi the government and

the people. The words emperiam and imperator always retain some·
thing oi their technical military meaning, asin the passage irom Τ111-
tus eited next. quamvis . . . dubitasset: see Introd. 11. §ab
(5). Os. Tacitus, Ana. i. 7, who states that on Augustus' death,
{liber-ius, as their imperator, gave 111 watchword to the praetorians3
that armed guards surrounded the palace and accompanied him into
the Forum and Curia ; and that there were all other indicatione oi an
imperial court, 111111, 1111 11 shewed hesitation in nothing, except
when addressing the senate. Velleius' view, ii. 124, is different. He
represents that there was a veritable contest between Tiberius and the
state, the latter endeavoring to prevail upon him to become its prinae,
and he struggling to remain iu 1 private station.

4. statione militum: this refers to the excubiae, or detail 111111-
torians, on guard at the paleae. Roth's text reads 1111111111 militum.
Madvig seems correct 11 considering the et 11 the manuscripts 1 repe-
tition 11 the last syllable 11 111 preceding verb.

6. impudentissimo mimo: 1111 11111111 baresaced 1111111111.
