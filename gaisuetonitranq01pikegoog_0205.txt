Aua. 1186 (19 aa), is not much more explicit. He states, however,
that iour thousand ireedmen were expelled to Sardinia, charged with
being disciples of these cults. From Josephus, Aet Jud. xviii. 3, 4, we
learn the circumstances. The temple oi Isis was destroyed and its
priests were crucified by Tiberius, because oi an outrage perpetrated
bya¹ Roman knight upon a woman oi rank in this temple, with the
assistance oi the priests. The Jews were punished because four oi
that sect had persuaded one oi their proselytos, a noble Roman lady,
to send as gilas to the temple oi Jerusalem sums which they had
stolen. In general, it may be said that the Romans were very tolerant
toward foreign culis. They were aggressively hostile only toward
those oreeds which, like the Christian and J ewish, were of aproselyt-
ing tendency and hostile to the state religion, or toward those which,
like Dmidism, fostered national sentimenta detrimental to Roman
dominion.
