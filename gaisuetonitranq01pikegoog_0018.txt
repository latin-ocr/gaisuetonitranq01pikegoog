Suetonius of necessity refleets the literary tendencies of
his time3 yet his style is less typical of the Silver Age than
that of any other writer of the period. His use of Greek
words and poetical phrases and constructions seems to be
due to the influence of the age rather than to his personal
inclinatior. He aims at clearness‚ simplicity, and brevity,
though on occasions condensation is attained at the expense
of elearness. The brevity of Suetonius' diction is not epi-
grammatis, nor employed with evident artistic purpose. It
is the brevity of economy, which aime to express the thought ,
in the simplest and fewest words. N eglect of concinnity and
parallelism of construction, while not carried to excess as in
Tacitus, are peculiarities of Suetonius' style. The sentences
are comparatively short, and there is aa entire absence of
the periodic structure. As would be expected from these
traits, his prose is not harmonicus, In fact, he seems to be
utterly lacking in a feeling for rhythm. He does not strive
for effect, and his diction is singularly free from rhetorical
ornamentation. He keeps himself entirely out of his works,
with the result that his style is somewhat colorless. Its
very simplicity, however, gives an element of strength and
vigor. The following are the most notieeable linguistie'
characteristics:
