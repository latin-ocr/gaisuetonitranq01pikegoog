at Baiae to rival a similar structure of Xerxes over the
Hellespont, he goes on to say that, when a boy, he had
heard his grandfather give a different explanation.¹ In a
passage of the De Gramrmticir⁹ he states that he recalls

from the period of his youth the system of declamation and
disputation employed by the rhetorician Princeps, Suetonius
probably spent his early years at Rome, for, in speaking of
the cruelty of Domitian, he remarks that he himself, when
a youth, was present (ie. in Rome) on one occasion, when
an investigation was beingmade to determine whether a
certain aged man was a J ew.³ Another personal reference
is met with in the statement that during his youth, twenty
years after the death of Nero (ie. after the year 88 and be-
fore the death of Vologesus in 91), a pseudoNero had great
influence at the court of the Parthians*
The letters of Pliny the Younger throw some light upon
the life of Suetonius between the years 96 and 112 or
thereabout. The first nine books of these let
{xm} ters were written after the death of Domitian,
and before Pliny was appointed governor of
Bithynia and Pontus. The tenth contains the official cor-
respondence that passed between Trajan and Pliny, his
representative, chiefly in regard to the administration of
the province. The earliest of these letters addressed to
Suetonius shows that the latter was about twenty-six years
of age at the time, while the latest attests that he was not
far from forty. ¹
