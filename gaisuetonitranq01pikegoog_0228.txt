whether silver dishes with golden emblema were forbidden, Tiberius
issued a new detrec, but forbsde the use of the word ‘emblem' be-
cause it was Greek, and that, too, notwithstanding the fact that there
was no exact equivalent in Latin.'’

7. ἶμβλημιε the emblemata were inlaid figures of metal attached by
riveting or soldering to the exterior or interior of oups. For this word

the Latin had no equivalent, as the sipllla, a word of nearly the same ἵ

meaning, probably formed an integral part of the ressel.

8. nostratem: so. vocem.

9. per ambitum verborum: by a circumlocutioa. In Latin
rhetoric the word arabitur also means ‘the period'

10. Graece . . . interrogatum: why he was questioned in Greek -
isnot apparent. Possibly his interlocutor knew no Latin. Cf. Dio,
lvii. 15, “ He likewise forbads a centurion, who was about to gire his
testimony iu Greek before the senate, to do so, though he had himself
listened to many cases presented in that language before that body,
and had selred questions with regard to many of these.'’

12. redire conatus: as. Tac. Ana. vi. 1 (32 s.n.): “Tiberius
sailed along the coast of Campania, either intending to enter the city,
or making that pretence, because he had really deoided not to do s0.
He sven came as far as the gardens of the Tiber, but ashamed of his
wickedness aud lust, he again made for bis solitary retreat among the
rocks in the sea.”

1³. ad proximo· naumachlae hortos: to the pardeus tltat aere
mear the amfflofal lake devoted to aaual maaoeuures. The word aau-
mac-lm'a means either a sham naval battle, as in Claud. chop. 21. 14, or
the place of such an exhibition, es in the present instance. This
naumachia was the naumachia uetus oi Augustus ln the XIVth rapio
of the city across the Tiber, on one edge of which was the grove of
the Caesam. Cf. Aup. 43, item aaoale proelium circa Tiberim cauato
solo laquo auae Caesarum aemus est. The Mau. Aaapraaum, chap.
23, gives the dimensione, naualis proeli spectaculum dedi troas
Tiberim, lu quo loeo auae nemus est Caesarum, cauato solo iu loupi-
tudt'aem mille et octingentos pedes, t'a latitudinem mille et ducentos.
Xiphilin, lxvi. 25, is authority for the statement that the place was used
for such exhibitione aiter the time of Augustus; as. Nero, chop. 27. 3. ,

14. statione: te. the guard or garrison stationed there.

15. appla: sc. Via, the great southern highway extending from
Rome to Brundisium. It followed the coast closely as far as Capua,
its original terminal. From there it was constructed across the penin-
sula to Brundisium.
