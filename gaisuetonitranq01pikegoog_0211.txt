20. Actium manumittere: this is probably the ease referred to
by Dio, lvii. ll, where he states that 'liberius was so fair and just
that when the people demanded the manumission oi an actor, he
would not permit it until the owner had signified his ,willingness and
had received his price.

22. nisi wnatui. . probassent: Tacitus, Aua i. instruentes
this conduct on the part oi Tiberius to his love oi severity, which he
displayed even in meritorious actions. Velleius' explanation (ii. 129)
is more lavorabis. He implies thet the senate was asked to pass upon
such cases in the interest oi frugality and economy.

25. auctore Augusto, eta: ie. on the advice oi Augustus, he
married and raised a family.

27, proposito milies, etc. .· offeriup to loau for the space os tbree
years tlte sum os 100,000,000 sesterces without iuterest; cf. Die,
lviii. 21. Roth's text reads sestertio, a conjectu're oi Glareanus
for sestertium oi the manuscripts. In view oi the fact that almost
without exception the manuscripts oi Suetonius read sestertium in
passages where the numeral adverb is used, and where the sum
expressed is in the genitive and ablative (passages in Roth always
amended to sestertii and sestertio), it seems much safer to regard
the numeral as an indeclinable substantive and sestertium¹ as genitive
plural. In the present passage proposito milies is ablative absolute.
It must be acknowledged, however, that the forms sestertio and
sestertii do occur in such constructione with manuscript authority,
especially in Tacitus. The two construetione probably existed side
by side. See Hureord Studies iu Οῑαεείοαῑ Philoloyu, Vol. VII.,
p. 210 seq. -

29. quibusdam dominia, eto. .· Tacitus, Arsa. iv. 64 (at aa), tells
how the people murmured and said that Tiberius had formed the plan
to be absent, knowing it to be a year boding disaster. Their com-
plaints were silenced by his generosity. On the occasion oi a severe
fire ten years later, liberius again cameto the assistance oi his people.
This is passed over in silence by Suetonius. A corps oi ciuiles had
been formed in the year 6 nn, one oi whose duties was to protect
the city from these frequently recurringconiiagrstions. insularum:
insulae was the name given to the compact bloclrs, the apartment
houses oi the Romans. The detached mansion with its grounds was
called dotatis. .

30. magna difficultate nummaria: this stringency oi the year
33 arn. was due to the fact that all debts were called in, as explained
in note on p. 26, 3.
