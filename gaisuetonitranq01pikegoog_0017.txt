emper0r3 he then divides the reign into certain sections} i
treating separately the good and bad traits⁹ of his subject, Ὢ
but leaving no clear conception of the character as a whole.
The account of the death is preceded or followed by a
statement of the omens that presaged it. He pays no atten-
tion to chronological sequence in his narration, and displays
but little historical insight. He is a painstaking compilor ,
of data, and as such is valuable from the historical point of
view. No other author has related so many interesting
facts concerning the court life of the early empire of Rome.
Both Tacitus and Suetonius seem to be trustworthy in
respect to the facts thcy state, but here the lik'eness ends.
Suetonius attempta no philosophical discussion mm md

of character3 he merely enumeratos the vices suetonius

and virtues of his subject, without drawing ΜΡΝ
conclusions. There is no analysis of motives or emotions.
While Tacitus is a violent partisan, Suetonius dispession-
ately states facts without discussing them. He draws the
portraits of his Caesars as men rather than as rulers. He
possessas but little dramatic instinct, and what hc does
possess is displayed in narration³ rather than in the pres
entation of character.
