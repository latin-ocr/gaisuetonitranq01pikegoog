in the various libraries of Europe are of an>r great valae.
These manuscripts may be divided on the basis of their origin
into four classes, to the first of which belongs the Oodea
Memmianas, the oldest and most valuable, and the Gudianus.
The second class has as its type the third Mediccera, and in-
