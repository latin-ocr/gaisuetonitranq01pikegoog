In these letters Pliny shows that he held the character of
his friend in high esteem, and that he was solicitous for his
welfare. It was through Pliny's influence that the office of y.
military tribune was offered to Suetonius. This office, since
he did not care to accept it, he had transferred to a friend-
again through the kindness of Pliny.1 Pliny also inter-
ceded in behalf of Suetonius with reference to the purchase
of a piece of property,² and goes so far as to style him
“ contubernalis nens.'' When Suetonius was about to plead
acase, and was much perturbed in consequence of a dream,
it was Pliny who consoled and calmed him, and even
promised to secure a postponement of the trial³ It was
Pliny, too, who encouraged him to put the finishing touohes
to some of his writings and publish them* finally, in
soliciting from the Emperor Trajan the benefits of the ins
trium liberorum for Suetonius, he remarked that the longer
he knew him the more highly he prized him.l All this
from a man of Pliny's refinement and judgment argues for
the good qualities of Suetonius.

Though Suetonius was a lawyer, and filled some publio
posts during his life, yet he secmed hy nature suited to more
tranquil paths. He was in truth, as Pliny says,

a scholasticus.⁸ At Pliny's death, a dear friend ῗξᾱῒζζξω ⁸⁸⁸
of Pliny's, Gaius Septicius Clarus‚⁷ became η ’
Suetonius' patron. To this Septicius he dedicated his eight

books on the lives of the ansars, and it was through Septi-
cius' influence that he was appointed secretary to Hadrian.
At first upon friendly terms with the emperor,⁸ he, as well
as Septicius and others, afterward lost favor. Spartianus⁹
