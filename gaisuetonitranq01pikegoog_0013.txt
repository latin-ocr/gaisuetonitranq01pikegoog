errn most of the writers of the Silver Age, Gaius Suetonius
Tranquillus is exceedingly reticent as to his early life. He
states, however, that his father, Suetonius Laetus, ¹ a military
tribune, took part 111 the battle of Bedriacum,⁹
which was fought' ιιι the year 69 A n. To this Fffm
meagre information with regard to his family,

s Suetonius' contemporaries add nothing Not even tho placo
of his birth rs mentioned Vossius, a Dutch scholar of the
soventeenth tcentury, suggests³ that he was a native of
cisalpine Gaul, but adduces nothing more convincing to
support this theory than the fact that Suetonius' friend,
Pliny the Younger, was a native of that region. The year
of his birth, while quite uncertain, cannot be assigned to a
later date than 75 A. n, as may be inferred from apassage
cited later, ιιι which he speaks of a pseudoNero at the court
of Vologesus.

A few personal references relating to the period of his
youth are found ιιι his writings. For example,
