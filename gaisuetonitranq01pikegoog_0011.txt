Tris Licea os the (laesere contained in this collection are
of great interest to the student of Roman history, since
they treat of the period covered by the Accola of Tacitus,
by which they are so admirably illustrated and the gaps

of which they serve to bridge. The Licea are, too, in ·

special need of elucidation, partly because of their authors
disregard of chronological sequence and partly because of
their extreme conciseness. The Notes of this edition, there
fore, have been made rather full, with a view to confirm,
refute, or further illustrate the statements of Suetonius
by citations from other authors, especially from Tacitus,

' nro cassius, ana the racer’s abridger‚ xrpmnn.
No commentary on the Lives of this edition has, so far
as I am aware, been published in any modern language.

The old commentators, and the Baumgertcn-Crusius-Hase ’

edition in particular, have been of assistance in preparing
the Notes3 but of necessity, in an edition of this kind, much
of the work has been done independently. The text adopted
is that of Roth (1857), with modifications.

Iwish to express my great indebtedness to Professor
Oharles E. Bennett and Professor John C. Rolfe for their
many valuable suggestions. Ialso appreciate the assistance
given me by my colleague, Dr. John E. Granrud, who read
critically the proof of the commentary.
